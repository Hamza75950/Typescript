//14. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner. 

let guest_list = ["Albert Enistine", "Stephen Hawking", "Elon Musk","Allen Turing"]

for (let i = 0 ; i< guest_list.length; i++ )
{
    console.log(guest_list[i] + ", I cordially invite you to the dinner to be held at my residence from 7 pm onwards next Sunday");
