//13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let fav_transport = ["motorcycle","car","jet","ship"]
console.log("I would like to own a honda " + fav_transport[0]);
console.log("I would like to go on a long drive in Mclarean " + fav_transport[1] );
console.log("Businessmen fly in private "+fav_transport[2]+" to save time");
console.log("I woulld love to go on a trip in cruise " + fav_transport[3]);
