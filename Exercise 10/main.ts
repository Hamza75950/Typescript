//10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

//1st program
//Name: Muhammad Ameer Hamza Khan Niazi
//Date: 7/7/23

// addition
console.log(7+1);
//subtraction
console.log(17-9);
//multiplication
console.log(8*1);
//division
console.log(16/2);


//2nd program
//Name: Muhammad Ameer Hamza Khan Niazi
//Date: 7/7/23

//store famous person name in variable 
let famous_person_ = "Stephen Hawking";
//store message  in message variable
